  <b>Text synthesis</b> refers to the process wherein a machine creates meaningful combinations of words serving 
  a particular purpose. Even though it can be technically termed as 'generation,' the real process is about 
  discovering combinations of words that are highly likely to carry meaning for the humans who had created 
  all the texts used in training of a language model.
