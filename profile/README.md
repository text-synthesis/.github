  <b>Text synthesis</b> refers to the process wherein a machine creates meaningful combinations of words serving 
  a particular purpose. Even though it can be technically termed as 'generation', the real process is about 
  discovering combinations of words that are highly likely to convey <i>meaning</i> to the humans who had created 
  all the texts used in training of a language model.
  
  Texts serving a purpose are 'speech' in a broad sense of the word. These, as philosophers call them - 'speech acts', 
  can be directed outwards as it is the case with requests, promises, predictions, and the like then they are 
  'speech acts' per se; or be directed inwards, at the self, the speaker; then it is what philosophers call 'inner 
  speech'; they are 'speech acts' upon self none the less, because they change thoughts.
